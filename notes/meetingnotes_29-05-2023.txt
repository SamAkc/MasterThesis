citizens of Bamberg as Stakeholder

Dr. Fokens problem
our problem: we want to make a tool that Dr. Foken can use to identify so they can understand the data, check what they want, make their life easier
process of getting data takes a lot of time: they go to the website, they take the data, transfer each entry of data etc. -> waste of time

-> they want us to get the data easily

create a website, so user can login to Netatmo
use Reem's code to show data, I need to visualize data in a nice way to Stakeholders
include graphs for example, 
-> target group limited: klimamessnetz Bamberg (Dr. Foken/David Keil...)
